
## Amazon API Gateway

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application.


# Mock Integrations in API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway supports mock integrations for API methods. This feature enables API developers to generate API responses from API Gateway directly, without the need for an integration backend. As an API developer, you can use this feature to unblock dependent teams that need to work with an API before the project development is complete. You can also use this feature to provision a landing page for your API, which can provide an overview of and navigation to your API. For an example of such a landing page, see the integration request and response of the GET method on the root resource of the example API discussed in [Build an API Gateway API from an Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-from-example.html).
