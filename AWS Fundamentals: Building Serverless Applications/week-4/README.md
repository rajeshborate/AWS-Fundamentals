## Deploying an Amazon Lex Bot on a Messaging Platform

We explained how to integrate our Lex bot with Facebook messenger. As noted, in Addition to Facebook messenger, you can deploy your Lex bot on Slack and Twilio.

Examples and details about how to do this can be found in the [Lex Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/example1.html).
