# Week 5 - Security, Cost Management and Course Conclusion

AWS is responsible for security of the host operating system, virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the services operate. The customer is responsible and manages the guest OS, applications running. This is called the "shared security". The difference is often referred to as "Security *of* the Cloud" vs "Security *in* the Cloud".
